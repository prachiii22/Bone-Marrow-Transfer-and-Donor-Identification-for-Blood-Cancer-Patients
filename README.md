# Bone-Marrow-Transfer-and-Donor-Identification-for-Blood-Cancer-Patients
The Bone Marrow Transfer and Donor Identification for Blood Cancer Patients (BMT-DIBCP) project provides an integrated system designed to assist blood cancer patients in finding suitable bone marrow donors. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) for predicting donor compatibility and integrates a Django-based backend (written in Python) to manage the data, with a mobile application (using React Native) and web-based frontend (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for user interaction.

The system has two main modules:
1. Bone Marrow Transfer Compatibility Matching: Using machine learning algorithms (such as KNN), the system predicts whether a donor's bone marrow is compatible with a patient.
2. Donor Identification: The system helps identify suitable bone marrow donors for blood cancer patients based on attributes like age, blood type, and genetic data.
This project is designed to improve the process of finding compatible donors and ensuring safe bone marrow transplants for blood cancer patients.

Technologies Used
Backend: Django (Python), Django REST Framework
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (KNN algorithm)
Frontend: React Native, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
